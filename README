Description:

Clean the cruft from your channels file - i.e. turn on add channels without
fear of being overwhelmed.

Sort your channels into logical groups.

Example config file is in examples/decruft.conf

Apply the patch in patches before compilation - if you've already got the
source dependent channel insertion patch then you won't need this.

TODO:

- Cleanup on demand
- Configure cleanup period (it's 10 mins ATM)
- Configure filters using OSD?
