# Lines can begin with clean: or with keep:
#
# keep: lines have a higher priority i.e. they can undo a previously
# defined clean: line
#
# Operators:
# ca=	- Check CAs - will check all available CAs
# provider= - Regex to match provider
# name=	    - Regex to match channel name
# source=   - Match the channel source
# vpid=	    - Check the video pid
# apid=	    - Checks the first audio pid
# dpid=	    - Checks the first dolby pid
# tpid=	    - Checks the teletext pid
#
# apid/dpid only check the first since it's useful to check for =0 i.e.
# a dead channel that is still in the tables
#
# Operators can be combined on a single line separated by semicolons
# Multiple pids/cas can be separated by commas
# A semicolon (;) ends a name/provider


# Kill dead channels on Sat
